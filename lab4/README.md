# Third Lab of IADI 2022

The code for this lab contains samples of JPA associations that you can explore to define 
your own data model and data layer. This project contains a class that implements the 
`CommandLineRunner` interface in order to initialize the database with seed data. It also
contains samples of queries with and without prefetching of data.
